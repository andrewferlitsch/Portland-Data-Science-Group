<p>
The coding examples in this section are basic algorithms. A coding portion of a technical interview will likely start with one of these types
of algorithms. Typically, after asking you to code the basic algorithms, you will be ask to make improvements or other variations. If you are 
unable to pass this part of the coding portion, you will probably not continue to the next round of interview.
</p>

<h3>1. Prime Numbers</h3>
<p>
The most basic coding example you might get asked is to write an algorithm to output a series of prime numbers.
Prime numbers are numbers that are only divisible by one and itself. The algorithm is a 
straight forward iterative algorithm.
</p>
<p>
The number one is a prime number, since it can only be divisible by itself. The
number two is also a prime number, since there are no numbers between one and two
to divide by. Therefore, I generally like to start the iterative process at three, though
you may choose to start it at two.
</p>
<h4>Algorithm</h4>
<ol>
	<li>For each number, we attempt to divide it by every number less than it, except for one.</li>
	<li>The integer modulo operator is used to test if there is a remainder from the integer division.</li>
	<li>If there is no remainder, it is divisible by the number and therefore not a prime.</li>
	<li>If each of the numbers it is divided by has a remainder, it is a prime.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Python</h4>
<pre>

print( "Prime Numbers between 1 and 100")

# Prime Numbers are numbers only divisible by 1 and itself.
print( "1" )	
print( "2" )

# Primes for numbers above 2
for number in range( 3, 101 ):
	# Attempt to divide this number by every number between 2 and one less than itself
	for div in range(2,number):
		# use the mod function to see if their is a remainder in the division
		if ( number % div ) == 0:
			break
	else:
		print(number)
		
</pre>

<h4>Java</h4>
<pre>

public class prime {
	public static void main( String args[] ) {
		System.out.println( "Prime Numbers between 1 and 100");

		// Prime Numbers are numbers only divisible by 1 and itself.
		System.out.println( "1" );
		System.out.println( "2" );

		// Primes for numbers above 2
		for ( int number = 3; number <=100; number++ ) {
			// Attempt to divide this number by every number between 2 and one less than itself
			int div = 2;
			for ( /**/; div < number; div++ ) {
				// use the mod function to see if their is a remainder in the division
				if ( ( number % div ) == 0 )
					break;
			}
			if ( div == number )
				System.out.println(number);
		}
	}
}

</pre>

<p>
Can we make an improvement? Yes. Since we know all even numbers are divisible by two, we
can skip checking even numbers and only check odd numbers. Likewise, since we know odd numbers are not divisible by even numbers,
we can skip dividing by even numbers and only divide by odd numbers.
</p>

<h4>Algorithm - Skip even numbers</h4>
<ol>
	<li>For each odd number, we attempt to divide it by every odd number less than it, except for one and two.</li>
	<li>The integer modulo operator is used to test if there is a remainder from the integer division.</li>
	<li>If there is no remainder, it is divisible by the number and therefore not a prime.</li>
	<li>If each of the numbers it is divided by has a remainder, it is a prime.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Python</h4>
<pre>

print( "Prime Numbers between 1 and 100")

# Prime Numbers are numbers only divisible by 1 and itself.
print( "1" )	
print( "2" )	
print( "3" )

# Primes for numbers above 5
for number in range( 5, 101, 2 ):
	# Attempt to divide this number by every odd number between 2 and one less than itself
	for div in range(3,number,2):
		# use the mod function to see if their is a remainder in the division
		if ( number % div ) == 0:
			break
	else:
		print(number)
		
</pre>

<h4>Java</h4>
<pre>

public class prime {
	public static void main( String args[] ) {
		System.out.println( "Prime Numbers between 1 and 100");

		// Prime Numbers are numbers only divisible by 1 and itself.
		System.out.println( "1" );
		System.out.println( "2" );
		System.out.println( "3" );

		// Primes for numbers above 5
		for ( int number = 5; number <=100; number += 2 ) {
			int div = 3;
			// Attempt to divide this number by every odd number between 3 and one less than itself
			for ( /**/; div < number; div += 2 ) {
				// use the mod function to see if their is a remainder in the division
				if ( ( number % div ) == 0 )
					break;
			}
			if ( div == number )
				System.out.println(number);
		}
	}
}

</pre>

<p>
Can we make another improvement? Yes. Since we are skipping even numbers, we know that each number to be prime must be divisible by at least the number three.
Therefore, any divisible number must be one-third or less the value of the number. We can cut down on the number of iterations by only dividing
the first 1/3 of values less than the number.
</p>

<h4>Algorithm - Skip even numbers, and divide only by numbers one-third or less than the number.</h4>
<ol>
	<li>For each odd number, we attempt to divide it by every odd number that is less than one-third of the number, except for one and two.</i>
	<li>The integer modulo operator is used to test if there is a remainder from the integer division.</li>
	<li>If there is no remainder, it is divisible by the number and therefore not a prime.</li>

	third = int( (number / 3 ) ) + 1
	for div in range(3,third,2):
		# use the mod function to see if their is a remainder in the division

			break
	else:
		print(number)

<h3>2. Fibonacci Sequence</h3>
<p>
One of the most common and basic coding examples is to code a solution for the Fibonacci sequence. A Fibonacci sequence is a function where F(N) equals
F(n-1) + F(n-2); that is the summation of the previous two values in the sequence. Originally, the seed sequence was F(0) = 1 and F(1) = 1, but modern
solutions use F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1. This sequence can be written in a very short recursive algorithm.
</p>

<h4>Algorithm - Recursive</h4>
<ul>
	<li>If n = 0, then return 0.</li>
	<li>If n = 1, then return 1.</li>
	<li>If n > 1, return the sum of F(n-1) + F(n-2)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Python</h4>

<pre>

# Fibonacci Sequence
# Is a sum (addition) of the previous two numbers in the sequence, as
#	F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
# Where
# 	F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1
# Hence 
#	F(2) = 0 + 1 [F(1) + F(0)] = 1
#	F(3) = 1 + 1 [F(2) + F(1)] = 2

# Recursive Solution
def Fibonacci(n):
	# F(0) and F(1) case
	if n==0:
		return 0
	if n==1:
		return 1
	return Fibonacci(n-1) + Fibonacci(n-2)

# Fibonacci Sequence to F(10)
for number in range( 0, 10 ):
	print( Fibonacci(number) )
	
</pre>

<h4>Java</h4>
<pre>

public class fibonacci {
	public static void main( String args[] ) {
		System.out.println( "Fibonacci Sequence to F(10)");

		for ( int number = 0; number < 10; number++ )
			System.out.println( Fibonacci( number ) );

	}
	
	// Recursive Solution
	public static int Fibonacci( int n) {
		if ( n == 0 ) return 0;
		if ( n == 1 ) return 1;
		return Fibonacci( n - 1 ) + Fibonacci( n - 2 );
	}
}

</pre>

<p>
It is common to be asked if you can write the algorithm for an iterative solution (looping - no recursion).
</p>

<h4>Algorithm - Iterative</h4> 
<ul>
	<li>If n = 0, then return 0.</li>
	<li>If n = 1, then return 1.</li>
	<li>If n > 1, then set last F(n-2) = 0, and last F(n-1) = 0, and F(n) initialized to zero.</li>
	<li>Loop from 2 to n.
		<ul>
			<li>Set current F(n) to current F(n-1) + F(n-2).</li>
			<li>Set F(n-2) to current F(n-1).</li>
			<li>Set F(n-1) to current F(n).</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h4>Python</h4>
<pre>

def FibonacciIterative(n):
	# F(0) and F(1) case
	if n==0:
		return 0
	if n==1:
		return 1
	fn	  = 0	# current value for F(n)
	f_minus_1 = 1	# current value for F(n-1)
	f_minus_2 = 0	# current value for F(n-2)
	for i in range( 2, n+1 ):
		fn        = f_minus_1 + f_minus_2   # F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)
		f_minus_2 = f_minus_1               # next F(n-2)
		f_minus_1 = fn                      # next F(n-1)
	return fn
		
# Fibonacci Sequence to F(10)
for number in range( 0, 10 ):
	print( FibonacciIterative(number) )

<h3>3. Dynamic Arrays</h3>
<p>
A dynamic array is an array that can be resized, can be randomly accessed via an cardinal ordering, where there is a one-to-one relationship
between an integer index and a value. For example, if a dynamic array cans the ordered elements A, B and D, they would be accessed (one-to-one relationship)
by indices 0=>A, 1=>B and 2=>D. If we insert a C between B and D, the ordering would be rearranged but there still would be a one-to-one relationship, accessed
as indices 0=>A, 1=>B, 2=>C and 3=>D. Note how index 2 now relates to C and index 3 to D.
</p>

<p>
You maybe asked to implement a dynamic array using a class. You would be expected to implement at least and Add() and Get() methods.

<h4>Algorithm</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Define a class for an element.
		<ul>
			<li>Has a member to hold the value</li>
			<li>Has a next pointer for the next element in the array.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Define a class for an array.
		<ul>
			<li>Has a member to hold the head and a member to hold the tail of the array.</li>
			<li>A member to hold the size of the array.</li>
			<li>Define a Add method.
				<ul>
					<li>Instantiate a new element.</li>
					<li>Add the element to the end of tail (the tail's next pointer) and update the tail to the new element.</li>
					<li>If it is the first element in the array, set the head to the new element.</li>
					<li>Increment the size of the array by one.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Define a Get method.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>Check for array out of bounds condition.</li>
					<li>Starting with the head, advance consecutively index' number of times following the next pointer.</li>
					<li>Return the value of the current element.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

		for ( int i = 0; i < index; i++ )
			curr = curr.next;
			
		return curr.value;
	}
}

</pre>

<p>Once you've solved the Add() and Get() methods, you will likely be asked to code the methods for Delete() and Insert(). In the below coding
example, I solve for an insert after. You maybe additionally asked to code an insert before, or both.
</p>

<h4>Algorithm</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Define a Delete() method.
		<ul>
			<li>Check for array out of bounds condition.</li>
			<li>If deleting the head (index = 0), the set the new head to what the head currently points to.</li>
			<li>Starting with the head, advance consecutively index' number of times following the next pointer,
			and remember the element before it.</li>
			<li>Set the next pointer of the element before this element to this element's next pointer 
			(thus dropping this element which is in between).</li>
			<li>Decrement the size of the array.</li>
			<li>If the element deleted was the tail (index equals the new array size), set the tail to the previous element.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Define a Insert() after method.
		<ul>
			<li>Check for array out of bounds condition.</li>
			<li>If inserting after the tail (index == size-1), then insert the element using the Add() method.</li>
			<li>Advance to the element at the specified index, and remember the element before it.</li>
			<li>Instantiate a new element.</li>
			<li>Set the next pointer of the new element to the element following the current element.</li>
			<li>Update the next pointer of the current element to the new element (thus inserting in between).</li>
			<li>Increment the size of the array by one.</li>
		</ul>

<h3>4. Linked Lists - Queue</h3>
<p>
A linked list is a data structure where each element is linked to another element forming a chain, such as A links to B which links to C, and so forth.
Depending on the type of chaining, one can use link lists to code queues and stacks. A queue is also known as a FIFO (first-in-first-out) structure.
</p>
<p>
A queue consists of a head and a tail, where the head points to the first element in the queue, and the tail points to the end of the queue. Each new element
is added to the end of the tail, becoming the new tail. Throughout the chain, each element is linked to the next element starting from the head and
proceeding to the tail (forward chaining). A queue is typically used to process elements in the same sequential order they were added (FIFO). To process
an element, one removes the head (current element to process) of the queue and sets the new head to the next element following the previous head.
<p>

<h4>Algorithm - Queue</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Define a Task object
		<ul>
			<li>Define members for task to perform and next pointer for next element in the forward chain.</li>
			<li>Define a constructor to instantiate a Task.</li>
			<li>Define Next() methods to get and set the next element in the forward chain.</li>
			<li>Define an Action() method to process the element's task.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Define a Queue object
		<ul>
			<li>Define members for the head and tail of the queue.</li>
			<li>Define an Empty() method to test if the queue is empty.</li>
			<li>Define an Add() method to add a task to the tail of the queue.</li>
			<li>Define a Pop() method to process the task at the head of the queue and then set the head of the queue to the next element.</li>

<h3>5. Linked Lists - Stacks</h3>
<p>
A linked list is a data structure where each element is linked to another element forming a chain, such as A links to B which links to C, and so forth.
Depending on the type of chaining, one can use link lists to code queues and stacks. A stack is also known as a LIFO (last-in-first-out) structure.
while a stack is also known as a LIFO (last-in-last-out) structure.
</p>
<p>
A stack consists of a top, which points to the top of the stack. Each new element
is added to the top of the stack, becoming the new top. Throughout the chain, each element is linked to the next element starting from the top and
proceeding to the bottom (forward chaining). A stack is typically used to process elements in the reverse sequential order they were added (LIFO). To process
an element, one removes the top(current element to process) of the queue and sets the new top to the next element following the previous top.

<p>
A common variation you maybe asked is to redesign your stack into a chain of stacks of fixed size. When an element is pushed to a stack
that has reached it's maximum (fixed) size, the bottom if the stack is removed and pushed to the top of the next stack on the chain
and so forth. Likewise, when an element is popped from the stack, the top of the next stack that is chained to it is popped and added
to the bottom of the stack, and so forth.
</p>
<p>
Unlike the previous stack example, where we implicitly performed the task when it was popped, we will this time return the task on a pop and
let the application explicitly invoke performing the task. This will simplify the push and pop operations in a chain.

<h3>6. Binary Tree</h3>

<p>
A binary tree is a tree where each node contains at most two branches (subtrees), commonly known as the left tree and right tree. The recursive
definition is a binary tree is either empty or a single node, where the left and right branches are binary subtrees.
</p>
<pre>
binary tree:    empty node |  
                node
                    left binary subtree
                    right binary subtree
</pre>
<p>
Some other terminology that is useful to know:
<ul>
	<li>The topmost node is the root.</li>
	<li>Nodes at the same level are siblings.</li>
	<li>Nodes with no branches are leaf nodes (or leaves).</li>
	<li>Every node with branches is a parent. The nodes are the branches are children.<li>
	<li>A branch is a directed edge.</li>
	<li>A node depth is the number of edges between the root and the node.</li>
	<li>A node height is the number of edges between the node and the deepest leaf node.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
You may be asked to code a class definition for a binary tree node. The binary tree node will have the following members/methods:
<ul>
	<li>Constructor for instantiating the node and initializing the node data. In my examples, I use the data type 'Object' (Java) to indicate that
	the node is not limited to the type of data it can hold, which is determined at run-time.</li>
	<li>Private member fields (only accessible by the class object) for the data value, left and right subtrees.</li>
	<li>Public Set and Get accessors for the data value, left and right subtrees, which can be used by a program accessing the class object.</li>
</ul> 
</p>

<p>You maybe asked for a more generalized representation, such as defining a hierarchical class structure where a binary tree is a class type
of a k-ary tree. For this, we would define a base (super) class with methods common to k-ary trees, and then derive (extend) a binary tree 
class from the base (super) class with methods specific to a binary tree.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The base class defines the key member and corresponding access methods.</li>
	<li>The base class is made abstract, so that one has to derive (extend) a class to use it.</li>
	<li>An abstract method (must be defined in derived class) is added to defining an action to perform on each node in the tree that is
	specific to a derived class.</li>
</ul>

<h3>7. Binary Tree Traversals</h3>

<p>
Binary trees can be traversed either breadth first or depth first. In a breadth first traversal, the tree is traversed one level at a time. 
The root node (level 1) is first visited, then the left and right node (level 2) of the root, and then the left and right nodes of these subtrees (level 3),
and so forth.
</p>
<p>
For depth first traversal or search (DFS), a tree can be traversed either inorder, preorder or postorder.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Inorder: left (node), root, right</li>
	<li>Preorder: root, left, right</li>
	<li>Postorder: left, right, root</li>
</ul>
<p>
If you are ask questions about a binary search tree (BST), most likely the algorithm will use a postorder traversal.
</p>

<h4>Algorithm - Inorder</h4>
<ul>
	<li>From the current node (root), traverse to left node. Recursively apply algorithm to the left node.</li>
	<li>Traverse back to the root node.</li>

<p>
A breadth first traversal or search (BFS) traverses a tree one node level at a time, visiting each node at that level, generally from left to right.
This traversal is referred to as a level order traversal.
</p>

<h4>Algorithm - Level Order</h4>
<ul>
	<li>If the root node is non-null, add the root to the nodes to visit in sequential order.</li>
	<li>While there are nodes to visit, do:
		<ul>
			<li>Visit the next node</li>
			<li>Add the left node and right node of the visited node, if they exist to the nodes to visit.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h4>Java</h4>
<pre>

public class BFS {

		// Check if tree is empty

<h3>8. k-ary Trees</h3>
<p>
As a follow up to coding examples related to a binary tree, you maybe asked to generalize a solution for a k-ary tree. A k-ary tree is a tree
that may at most k children. You may be challenged, by being asked to create a base (super) class from which any k-ary tree can derived (extended)\
from, with the condition that the children (branch) members must be defined in the base (super) class.
</p>
<p>
Since we do not know in the base (super) class how many children (branches) each node will have, we will use a dynamic array to represent the
member for children. In the Java coding example, I will use the predefined dynamic array type ArrayList.
</p>

<h4>Algorithm</h4>
<ul>
	<li>The base class defines the key member and corresponding access methods.</li>
	<li>The base class defines a member for the maximum number of children and a dynamic array for pointers to the children.</li>
	<li>The base class is made abstract, so that one has to derive (extend) a class to use it.</li>
	<li>An abstract method (must be defined in derived class) is added to defining an action to perform on each node in the tree that is
			specific to a derived class.</li>
	<li>The base class defines a Add() method for adding a child (branch) to the node.</li>
	<li>The base class defines a Children() method for accessing all the children (branches) of the node.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Java</h4>
<pre>

import java.util.ArrayList;

// Base (Super) class definition for a k-ary tree
abstract class KNode {
	// node data
	private Object key;
	// max number of children
	private final int k;
	
	// Dynamic array for children
	private ArrayList<KNode> children = new ArrayList();
	
	// action to perform on a node
	public abstract void Action();
	
	// constructor: set the node data
	public KNode( int k, Object key ) {
		this.key = key;
		this.k   = k;
	}
	
	// Set the node data
	public void Key( Object key ) {
		this.key = key;
	}
	
	// Get the node data
	public Object Key() {
		return key;
	}
	
	// Get the number of children
	public int Size() {
		return children.size();
	}
	
	// Add another child (branch)
	public KNode Add( Object key ) {
		// exceeds number of allowed children
		if ( Size() == k )
			return null;
		Tree e = new Tree( k, key );
		children.add( e );
		return e;
	}
	
	// Get all the children of this node
	public ArrayList<KNode> Children() {
		return children;
	}
}

// Definition for a k-ary tree
class Tree extends KNode {
	public Tree( int k, Object key ) {
		super( k, key );
	}
	
	public void Action() {
		// do something
	}
}
</pre>

<h3>9. Binary Search Tree</h3>
<p>
A binary search tree (BST) is a sorted tree where at each node, the data value of the left branch (child) is less than the data value of the node, and the right
node is greater than, and where there are no duplicate values. For example, if the data value of the root node is 5, and we added a node with value 3 it
would be inserted on the left branch, while a node of 7 would be inserted on the right branch.
</p>

<p>
You maybe asked to code the algorithm to insert, find and delete nodes a binary search tree.
</p>

<h4>Algorithm - Insert</h4>
<ul>
	<li>If the root node is null, make the root the node</li>
	<li>Otherwise, starting at the root, traverse the tree:
		<ul>
			<li>If the node is equal to the current node, then return (duplicate)</li>
			<li>If the node is less than the current node.
				<ul>
					<li>If the left node is null, then make the node the left node.</li>
					<li>Otherwise, traverse to the left node.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>If the node is greater than the current node.
				<ul>
					<li>If the right node is null, then make the node the right node.</li>
					<li>Otherwise, traverse to the right node.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h4>Java</h4>
<pre>

// Definition for a binary search tree
class BST {
	public BinaryTree root = null;	// root of the binary search tree
	
	// Insert a node into a binary tree
	public void Insert( BinaryTree node ) {
		// Empty Tree, make the node the root
		if ( root == null ) {
			root = node;
			return;
		}
		
		// Follow a path to insert the node
		BinaryTree curr = root;
		while ( true ) {
			// node is a duplicate, do not insert
			if ( (int) node.Key() == (int) curr.Key() ) {
				return;
			}
			
			// The node is less than the current node, traverse left
			if ( (int) node.Key() < (int) curr.Key() ) {
				// If there is no left node, make this node the left node
				if ( curr.Left() == null ) {
					curr.Left( node );
					return;
				}
				curr = curr.Left();
			}
			// The node is greater than to the current node, traverse left
			else {
				// If there is no right node, make this node the right node
				if ( curr.Right() == null ) {
					curr.Right( node );
					return;
				}
				curr = curr.Right();
			}
		}
	}
	
	// Driver method
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        BST tree = new BST();

<h4>Algorithm - Find</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Starting at the root, traverse a path in the tree.</li>
	<li>If the current node is null, return not found.</li>

		<ul>
			<li>If the node is the left node of the previous node, set the previous node's left node to null.</li>
			<li>Otherwise (is the right node of the previous node), set the previous node's right node to null.</li>
			<li>Remember the root and temporarily set the root to the previous node.</li>
			<li>If the left node of the current (deleted) node is non-null, then Insert() the current node's left node back into the tree.</li>

<h3>10. Arithmetic Operations</h3>
<p>
A very basic arithmetic problem you maybe asked is to implement a multiply operation where you can only use the addition and equality operator.
</p>

<h4>Algorithm - Multiply</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Initialize accumulators for result and repeat to 0.</li>
	<li>Loop indefinitely for 'x + y'</li>
	<ul>
		<li>If the repeat accumulator equals y, then break.</li>
		<li>Increment the repeat accumulator by one. </li>
		<li>Add x to the result accumulator.</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<h4>Python</h4>
<pre>

# Multiple using only + and = operator
def Mul( x, y ):
	result = 0  # accumlator for the result
	repeat = 0  # accumlator for the number of times to repeat the addition
		
	while ( True ):
		# starting at zero, exit the loop after y+1 times
		repeat += 1
		if repeat == y + 1:
			break
		# accumulate the result by adding x to the accumulator
		result += x;

	return result

print( Mul( 5, 6 ) )

</pre>

<h4>Java</h4>
<pre>

public class Calc
{
	// Multiple using only + and = operator
	public static int Mul( int x, int y ) {
		int result = 0;	// accumlator for the result
		int repeat = 0;	// accumlator for the number of times to repeat the addition
		
		while ( true ) {
			// starting at zero, exit the loop after y+1 times
			if ( repeat++ == y )
				break;
			// accumulate the result by adding x to the accumulator
			result += x;
		}
		return result;
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println( "5 * 6 = " + Mul( 5, 6 ) );
	}
}

</pre>

<p>
You would then be likely asked to extend the solution to include an exponent operation where you can only use the addition and equality operator.
</p>

<h4>Algorithm - Exponent</h4>
<ul>
	<li>If the exponent is zero, return 1.</li>
	<li>Initialize accumulators for result to 1 and repeat to 0.</li>
	<li>Loop indefinitely for 'x power e'</li>
	<ul>
		<li>If the repeat accumulator equals e, then break.</li>
		<li>Increment the repeat accumulator by one. </li>
		<li>Update the result accumulator to Mul(x, result).</li>
	</ul>
</ul>

<h4>Python</h4>
<pre>

....
# Exponent using only + and = operator
def Exp( x, e ):
	# x raised to power of 0 is always 1
	if e == 0:
		return 1
		
	result = 1	# accumlator for the result
	repeat = 0	# accumlator for the number of times to repeat the multiplication
	while ( True ):
		repeat += 1
		if repeat == e + 1:
			break
		result = Mul( x, result );

	return result

print( Exp( 3, 4 ) )

</pre>

<h4>Java</h4>
<pre>

public class Calc
{
	...
	
	// Exponent using only + and = operator
	public static int Exp( int x, int e ) {
		// x raised to power of 0 is always 1
		if ( e == 0 )
			return 1;
		
		int result = 1;	// accumlator for the result
		int repeat = 0;	// accumlator for the number of times to repeat the multiplication
		while ( true ) {
			if ( repeat++ == e )
				break;
			result = Mul( x, result );
		}
		return result;
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		System.out.println( "3 exp 4 = " + Exp( 3, 4 ) );
	}
}

</pre>

<h3>11. Variable Length Byte Encoding</h3>
You maybe asked to code a variable length byte encoding, using the least amount of bits for the encoding across all sequences. For example, some
encodings will be one byte, some two bytes, etc. In an encoding with between 1 and 8 bytes, if we restrict the first byte to must contain a zero
bit, then we can use the position of the zero bit to determine the byte length, while retaining the use of the less significant bits for the
encoding.
</p>

<h4>Algorithm</h4>
<ul>
	<li>If the most significant bit is zero, then the encoding is one byte long and the remaining bits are the encoding.</li>
	<li>If the most significant bit is one, the bit position (most to least significant) is the number of bytes in the encoding,
	and the remaining less significant bits in the first byte and all the bits in the remaining bytes are the encoding.
	</li>
</ul>

<h4>Java</h4>
<pre>

public class Encoding {
	public static int Size( byte[] encoding ) {
		byte first = encoding[ 0 ];
		// checking leading bit
		if ( ( first & 0x80 ) == 0 )
			return 1;
		if ( ( first & 0x40 ) == 0 )
			return 2;
		if ( ( first & 0x20 ) == 0 )
			return 3;
		if ( ( first & 0x10 ) == 0 )
			return 4;
		if ( ( first & 0x08 ) == 0 )
			return 5;
		if ( ( first & 0x04 ) == 0 )
			return 6;
		if ( ( first & 0x02 ) == 0 )
			return 7;
		if ( ( first & 0x01 ) == 0 )
			return 8;
		return 0;	// error
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		byte[] encoding = new byte[8];
		encoding[ 0 ] = (byte) 0x49;
		System.out.println( "Size(1) = " + Size( encoding ) );
		encoding[ 0 ] = (byte) 0x89;
		System.out.println( "Size(2) = " + Size( encoding ) );
		encoding[ 0 ] = (byte) 0xCB;
		System.out.println( "Size(3) = " + Size( encoding ) );
	}
}
